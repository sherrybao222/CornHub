These m files can be run on MATLAB. 

The "whole model" file is a simulation of the heavy metal detection biosensor's pathways.

The "without CRISPR" file is a simulation of the biosensor without dCas9-RNAP and sgRNA plasmids. 

By comparing the "whole model" with the "without CRISPR" output, the significant role of dCas9-RNAP in the biosensor can be determined. 

The sensitivity file is a sensitivity analysis of the parameters involved in the whole model.

The assumed concentration file is a simulation of the biosensor in the case of a hypothetical concentration of dCas9-RNAP.
