These m files can be run on MATLAB. 

The "whole model" file is a simulation of the entire biosensor, that is, the biosensor that introduces the dCas9-RNAP circuit, and the "whole model" includes the transcription and translation of ArsR, smURFP, dCas9-RNAP protein of sgRNA, ArsR and arsenic ions. The binding of the promoter, the binding of dCas9-RNAP to the sgRNA, and the formation of a complex enhancing the transcription of smURFP. 

The "without CRISPR" file is a simulation of biosensors that do not include dCas9-RNAP and sgRNA plasmids. 

By comparing the "whole model" with the "without CRISPR" output, the role of dCas9-RNAP in biosensors can be preliminarily determined. 

The ¡°sensitivity¡± file is a sensitivity analysis of the parameters involved in the entire model.

 The ¡°assumed concentration¡± file is a simulation of the biosensor in the case of a hypothetical concentration of dCas9-RNAP.
