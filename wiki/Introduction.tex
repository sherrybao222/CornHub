\section{Introduction}
Nowadays, the analysis of cleavage possibility can be devided into to type, i.e. meta-empirical and empirical. For the first one, many people develop the various score function based on experiment data to evaluate if a sgDNA is good or bad. Correspondingly, the other group chooce set up a theoretical model based on kinetic theory. But because using many approximations, it has drawbacks inevitably. 

Our model aims to investigate the off-target problem in gene editing by the CRISPR-Cas system, therefore finding efficient ways to enhance the reliability of gene editing. The foundations of this model are mostly simple probability theory and dynamic deduction, which make our model both convincing and pellucid.
	
Currently, people have constructed a similar model as illustrated in the following figure \ref{fig:1}. There are four common rules when Cas nuclease cleaves the DNA\cite{klein2018hybridization}.

(1) Seed region: single mismatch(es) within a PAM proximal seed region can completely disrupt interference\par
(2) Mismatch spread: when mismatches are outside the seed region, off-targets with spread out mismatches are targeted most strongly\par
(3) Differential binding versus differential cleavage: binding is more tolerant of mismatches than cleavage\par 
(4) Specificity-efficiency decoupling: weakened protein-DNA interactions can improve target selectivity while still maintaining efficiency\par

Based on these four rules, probability theory is applied in to explain it. As we know, there are always only two results in an experiment, which are successful cleavage and unsuccessful cleavage. In math view, it can be one-hot encoded, and they are corresponding to 1 and 0. 

However, giving a 0/1 prediction is hard and unreliable. To solve this problem, one choice is to consider it as a cluster problem; however, it is easier to find a continuous quantitative function rather than to find a suitable cluster distance function. So naturally, finding an approximate probability distribution is a good choice. 
	
In many target design toolkits, they use a score function with several parameters which can generate a score to evaluate whether the target is good or bad. Here we consider the score function has the similar ability to probability, which is a description of "better" or "worse" while canâ€™t affirm whether successful cleavage will appear. For our case, our goal is to find a function indicating which target is BETTER.
	
Considering the difference between model prediction and experimental data, our model consists of two aspects, which are kinetic inference and an updating module.
